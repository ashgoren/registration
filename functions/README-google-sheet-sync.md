# Automatically sync data to a Google Sheet

This sample demonstrates how to sync new data written to a Firebase database to a Google Sheet. It uses a service account for auth.

### This was initially based on Google's [starter code](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/main/google-sheet-sync).
### This code is also described in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@elon.danziger/fast-flexible-and-free-visualizing-newborn-health-data-with-firebase-nodejs-and-google-sheets-1f73465a18bc).
